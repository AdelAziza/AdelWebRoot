<li>Review of the article:
    The article <strong class="word1">"The Iphone's Sensors Explained"</strong> reviews three primary sensors that iPhone has, which are the accelerometer, the proximity sensor, and the ambient light sensor. First, <strong class=" word2">The Accelerometer sensor</strong> can be implemented on applications. The Apple iPhone was the first accessible mobile phone to make the accelerometer a key feature of its user interface. By proving a way of changing the display of the screen by being able to rotate. After reading the article, I was able to come up with an example, which is the landscape keyboard, and determine when to switch the screen. Second is <strong class=" word3">the Proximity Sensor </strong>the author declares that there is less proximity sensor in AppStore applications. However, the proximity sensor can happen when the screen is locked, and the light is off; if you touch or you become closer to the phone, the phone will try to unlock itself due to the proximity sensor. Finally, <strong class=" word4">the Ambient Light Sensor</strong> is a regular sensor applied inside iPhones mobile. The ambient sensor detects the lighting to be appealing to the eye. The article provides an example: when you wake the iPhone, place your finger on the sensor (it's located on the left-hand side, on the top of the iPhone's side), you force it into thinking that it's dark outside, it dims screen-brightness, and saves up battery."

<li>Review of the article: The article presents details on different types of sensors that mobile phones can have. I find three that captivated my attention because I never heard of them. First,<strong class="mot1"> GPS(Global Positioning System)sensor</strong> that communicate with the satellites to determine our precise location. Therefore, even with no internet, GPS will work. However, to use other location APPs such as  Google Maps, it required to have internet. Second, the Heart Rate Sensor helps to measure the heartbeat. The LED emits light towards the skin, and this smartphone sensor looks for the light waves reflected by it. <strong  class="mot2">A light-emitting diode (LED)</strong> is a semiconductor light root that transmits light when current runs through it. Electron in the semiconductor recombines with electron cells, releasing energy in the form of photons. There is a difference in light energy when there is a vibration. The heartbeat is measured by counting the changes in light energy between the minute beats of the blood veins. Some mobile Apps utilize the heart rate sensor to calculate the hearting, such as the iPhone.Finally, the Galaxy S4 was the first smartphone to use the air humidity sensor. The purpose of the air humidity sensor is to measure the humidity in the air, which will help users to know if the temperature and humidity are excellent to go outside or not. I found it really interesting to have this type of feature in our mobile applications.

<li>Review of the article:
The article explained one sensor that causes problems in many  mobile applications, which is <strong class=" mess1">the "calibration attack." </strong> A research made by the University of Cambridge provides details on how customers were being affected by the sensor calibration attack. When a user accesses a webpage, it will transmit queries to the exact device sensors via automated background processes that run when the page is loaded. According to the research, <strong class="mess2">iOS and Android devices</strong> are more exposed to this attack. However, Apple published a fingerprint device that will make a noise and make its devices to not vulnerable to the attack by the calibration. (March 2019).The research states that Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices were immediately attacked after experiments. It's impossible to remove the sheer design of sensors from computer and smartphone systems over the board, so a workaround like this might be one of the most basic of solutions. Any sensor calibration attack would also be entirely invisible to users because many applications and websites don't need specific authorization to reach sensor calibration data.

<li>Review of the article:
This article provides enough details on different sensors that mobile devices have by giving examples and images. It will present the visualization of the sensors. However, there is one that I find interesting, which is <strong class="me1">The gyroscope sensor </strong> that uses the accelerometer sensor to orientate a phone by adding a high level of precision for about 360-degree photospheres. Gyroscopes are not only using for phones, but it can be used in altimeters inside aircraft to determine height and position, for instance, keeping a camera stable.<strong class="me2">The first time MEMS  ( Micro Electro Mechanical Systems)</strong> gyroscopes appear in the iPhone 4 to be the first phone to be able to detect precise orientation.</li>
